Good evening, 

My mission has come to an end today at Oddo after more than three years.
I would like to get this opportunity to express my thanks to the CRM team, developers, managers, business analysts, and everyone who have helped me to achieve the mission.
It was an amazing experience where I have learned a lot on a personal and professional level.
By the end, I wish you all the best, and let's keep in touch.
Best Regards,
